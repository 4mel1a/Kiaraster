"..."

"Why are you eating a rock?"

Kiara stares at the girl with narrowed eyes, gaze flitting between the messy lump of light-grey rock in her hands, the chunks of it crusted around her purplish lips, and the gleaming fangs that juts out of her mouth slightly -- somehow not blunt despite her evident diet.

"..."

The other girl did not respond at first. Instead, she spends a few seconds chewing her mouthful with a sharp, grinding crunch of her jaws; then she spends a few second struggling to swallow the rock dust that assumedly filled her mouth; and then a few more seconds clearing her throat -- assumedly of some of the rock dust she just swallowed.

"Because it tastes good?" she finally replies, eyes narrowing back at Kiara. "Have you never tried one?"

Kiara's stare only grows blanker. "...No?"

"Really?" The girl's eyes widen. "Then why don't you try this one?"

Kiara steps forwards, moving towards the girl sat on the tree stump -- who is now holding out another one of the same rocks in her palm. She takes the rock from the girl, resting it in her palm; wiggling her hand up and down, then side-to-side, then both at once to try and get a sense of its weight; then, she flips it over and repeats the process -- continuing to do so as she replied, "Won't it hurt my teeth? They're not... really built for this sort of thing."

Kiara flashes the girl a smile -- bearing her sharp, serrated teeth at her, before realising the threat such a gesture might suggest, and then thinking better of it.

"I'll... probably ruin them if I try and eat it, won't I? Like eating a full bag of sweets every night..." She sighs.

"Maybe. Mine aren't built for it either, I guess, but I'm doing fine!" the girl replies, grinning at Kiara, showing a relatively normal set of teeth in response -- save for those odd fangs.

Wait, she thought to herself, why was she entertaining this prospect in the first place? It's a goddamn rock! Why would she eat a rock -- unless she was starving to death, or terminally calcium deficient, or brain damaged??

She sticks the rock back in her pocket, returning her attention to the girl in front of her. Like with the rock, she takes a moment to weigh her up: she glances back and forth over her smooth pink skin, short pink hair that covered her left, pupil-less red-pink eyes -- she was sensing a theme; a set of white freckles on her face -- as though someone had dropped a bucket of paint near her and she'd been hit by the splash; a simply excessive number of piercings; a long, tapering, heart-tipped tail and a pair of short purple horns -- probably a tiefling like Kiara herself. Regardless, nothing explained why the hell she was sat here -- rock or no rock -- in front of the same weird mine system where she'd run into those... demons. This girl looked like a demon, perhaps, but nothing like the demons she remembered from then.

Only one way to find out.

"Um. Okay. Rocks aside, who are you, anyway? Like, do we know each other, or something?" Kiara manages.

The girl freezes, rock chunks falling from her open palm.

"I'm, um, uh, um, A... As... Aslan..." The girl stammers.

"Aslan?" Kiara replies. "Okay. And your last name?"

"Last name? Yes!"

"...What."

"Aslan Lastname -- that's my name!"

Kiara blinks.

"Nice to, um see you again?? Um, yeah, nice to see you again, person-whose-name-I-know!" the girl continues, now sweating slightly harder.

Kiara blinks again. "This is ridiculous. That's the most fake name I've ever heard in my life -- and how the hell would you know me at all--

It is now Kiara's turn to freeze.

Her eyes widen.
