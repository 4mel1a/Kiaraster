"Why are you eating a rock?"

Kiara stares at the girl with narrowed eyes, gaze flitting between the messy lump of light-grey rock in her hands, the chunks of it crusted around her purplish lips, and two sharp-looking fangs that jut out of her mouth slightly -- somehow not blunt despite her evident diet.

"..."

The other girl doesn't respond. Instead, she spends a few seconds chewing her mouthful with a sharp, grinding crunch of her jaws; then she spends a few seconds struggling to swallow the rock dust that fills her mouth; and then a few more seconds clearing her throat -- assumedly of some of the rock dust.

"Because it tastes good?" she finally replies, eyes narrowing back at Kiara. "Have you never tried one?"

Kiara's stare only grows blanker. "...No?"

"Really?" The girl's eyes widen. "Then why don't you try this one?"

Kiara steps forwards, moving towards the girl sat on the tree stump -- who is now holding out another one of the same rocks in her palm. She takes the rock from the girl, resting it in her palm; wiggling her hand up and down, then side-to-side, then both at once to try and get a sense of its weight; then, she flips it over and repeats the process -- continuing to do so as she replies, "Won't it hurt my teeth? They're not... really built for this sort of thing."

Kiara flashes the girl a smile -- bearing her serrated teeth at her, then realising the threat such a gesture might suggest, then thinking better of it and shutting her mouth.

"I'll... probably ruin them if I try and eat it, won't I? They'll be gone before I even get halfway through the rock..." She sighs.

"Maybe. Mine aren't built for it either, I guess, but I'm doing fine!" the girl replies, grinning at Kiara, showing a relatively normal set of teeth in response, save for her longer canines.

Wait, Kiara thought to herself, why was she entertaining this prospect in the first place? It's a goddamn rock! Why would she eat a rock -- unless she was starving to death, or terminally calcium deficient, or brain damaged??

She sticks the rock back in her pocket, returning her attention to the girl in front of her. Like with the rock, she takes a moment to weigh her up: she glances back and forth over her smooth pink skin, her short pink hair that covered her left, her pupil-less red-pink eyes -- she was sensing a theme; a set of white freckles on her face -- as though someone had dropped a bucket of paint near her and she'd been hit by the splash; a simply excessive number of piercings; a long, tapering, heart-tipped tail and a pair of short purple horns, both meaning she was probably a tiefling too -- or, at least, some kind of fiend. Regardless, nothing explained why the hell she was sat here -- rock or no rock -- in front of the same weird mine system where she'd run into those... demons. Sure, whilst this girl looked like a fiend -- she certainly looked and acted nothing like those demons, that was certain.

Only one way to find out.

"Um. Okay. Rocks aside, who are you, anyway? Like, do we know each other, or something?" Kiara manages.

The girl freezes, rock chunks falling from her open palm.

"I'm, um, uh, um, A... As... Aslan..." The girl stammers.

"Aslan?" Kiara replies. "Okay. I'm, um, not sure if I know an Aslan. Last name?"

"Last name? Yes!"

"...What?"

"Aslan Lastname -- that's my name!"

Kiara blinks.

"Nice to, um, see you again?" 'Aslan' continues with a slight shake to her voice.
"Yeah, nice to see you again, person-whose-name-I-know!" Aslan repeats, now sounding slightly confident.

Kiara blinks again. "This is ridiculous. Even if I recognised you at _all_, that's by far the most _fake_ name I've ever heard in my life! How on earth could you possibly know me when I've obviously never seen you in my l--"

It is now Kiara's turn to freeze.

Her eyes widen.
