- [x] Kiara thinks Aster is from her "chat" and states that she doesn't "stream" any more
- [ ] Aster and Kiara are mutually suspicious that the other is a fey -- starting from Aster

Kiara takes a step back.

Then another.

Then another.

Then, with a sudden swoosh of air that blows the girl's hair back and forth, three pairs of bat-like wings unfurl themselves from Kiara's back, stretching out from behind her sweater; with one beat, they generate just enough lift to take her off the ground; with another beat, she is shifted away from the girl; with successive beats, she puts solid distance between the two of them.

"Y... You..." She stammers, her wide-eyes of terror meeting the girl's wide-eyes of confusion.

"Y-you're not from my chat, are you? I... No..." she continues, hands subconsciously curling into fists.

The girl narrows her eyes at Kiara. "...What's a chat?"

Kiara's fists tighten further, nails digging into her own skin. "Don't play dumb with me! I'm done with streaming, okay? Done!"

"...What's streaming?"

Kiara lets out a grunt. "It's not working on me. I can see through it. You know exactly what I'm talking about."

"...No? Like, I know what we're having right now is a chat -- but I don't know how I'd be from one, considering it's, like, a concept, and not a place; for streaming, the only time I do that is when I swim in one from time-to-time. Is there something wrong with that? Have I been swimming in dirty water by accident, or something?"

The girl shrugs.

Kiara's anger dissapears, her palms breathing a sigh of relief as her fists unclench; but, rather than gone entirely, it has instead morphed into confusion: unless this girl is some kind of professional actor, there's no way she could be this dumb on purpose, right? If she really knew Kiara, surely her reaction would falter from something other than that weird look of confusion on her face -- like a little hamster staring out of the bars of its cage, cute, but utterly devoid of conscious thought. Besides, the fact she didn't appear to be making any kind of move against her in this moment -- and was, rather, leaning down in order to shovel some pebbles from her hand into her mouth -- was enough to convince her. She might look like a demon, but this 'Aslan' was nothing of the sort. Not remotely cunning enough -- or, at least, so cunning she hadn't yet seen through it.
