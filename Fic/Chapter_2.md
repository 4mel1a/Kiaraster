Kiara takes a step back.

Then another.

Then another.

Then, with a sudden swoosh of air that blows the girl's hair back and forth, three pairs of bat-like wings unfurl themselves from Kiara's back, stretching out from behind her sweater; with one beat, they generate just enough lift to take her off the ground; with another beat, she is shifted away from the girl; with successive beats, she puts solid distance between the two of them.

"Y... You..." She stammers, her wide-eyes of terror meeting the girl's wide-eyes of confusion.

"Y-you're not from my chat, are you? I... No..." she continues, hands subconsciously curling into fists.

The girl narrows her eyes at Kiara. "...What's a chat?"

Kiara's fists tighten further, nails digging into her own skin. "Don't play dumb with me! I'm done with streaming, okay? Done!"

"...What's streaming?"

Kiara lets out a grunt. "It's not working on me. I can see through it. You know exactly what I'm talking about."

"...No? Like, I know what we're having right now is a chat -- but I don't know how I'd be from one, considering it's, like, a concept, and not a place; for streaming, the only time I do that is when I swim in one from time-to-time. Is there something wrong with that? Have I been swimming in dirty water by accident, or something?" The girl shrugs.

Kiara's anger disappears, her palms breathing a sigh of relief as her fists unclench; but, rather than gone entirely, it has instead morphed into confusion: unless this girl is some kind of professional actor, there's no way she could be this dumb on purpose, right? If she really knew Kiara, surely her reaction would falter from something other than that weird look of confusion on her face -- like a little hamster staring out of the bars of its cage, cute, but utterly devoid of conscious thought. Besides, the fact she didn't appear to be making any kind of move against her in this moment -- and was, rather, leaning down in order to shovel some pebbles from her hand into her mouth -- was enough to convince her. She might look like a demon, but this 'Aslan' was nothing of the sort. Not remotely cunning enough -- or, at least, so cunning she hadn't yet seen through it.

Kiara sighs, the beating of her wings slowing to the point "Fine. I guess not -- but that doesn't make your name any less fake, 'Aslan Lastname', nor does it make you any less of a stranger. Who are you _actually_?"

'Aslan' shakes her head. "Nuh-uh! I don't just give out my name like that to complete strangers -- for all I know, you could be some kind of powerful archfey! You certainly have the look of one."

"Archfey? What makes _me_ look like an 'archfey'?"

"Well, the pretty wings, the white hair, the weird eyes, all sorts of things!"

"Hm. Fair enough, I suppose I--"

Kiara pauses.

"Hey, hold on a sec..."

She stares into 'Aslan's' eyes.

"What do you mean I have 'weird eyes'? Yours are way stranger than mine!"

"What? What about them makes them strange?"

"Yours don't have pupils, for goodness sake!"

'Aslan' considers this for a moment.
"Huh. I guess not."

"Exactly!" Kiara replies. "So I how do I know you aren't a fey?"

'Aslan' shrugs. "I dunno."

"You 'dunno'?"

"Yup. I dunno. Even more reason to give each other fake names then, right, person-whose-name-I-know?"

Kiara gives an exasperated sigh.
"Sure. Whatever, I guess. What are you doing here, anyway?" she asks, landing on the ground next to 'Aslan'. "You're not from my chat and you're... _probably_ not a fey, so what business do you have here? It's dangerous as hell out here -- last time I came, it was swarming with weirdos with cattle prods."

"I dunno what a cattle prod is, but this place has some pretty sweet rocks. Like this one," she says, picking up a pebble from the ground, tossing it into the air, and catching it in her jaws, before biting down on it with another crunch, making Kiara shudder slightly at the awful sound. "Good stuff. A little salty, sure, but good stuff nonetheless."

"A cattle prod is a little electric..." she sighs, spotting another of 'Aslan's' just-not-getting-it looks spread plainly across her face. "Don't worry about it." A little smile replaces 'Aslan's' look of confusion.

Ugh, Kiara thinks. There's something cute about that stupid little grin of hers -- something that makes her want to stick around for a bit, rather than just leaving 'Aslan' at the mercy of whatever's lurking in the cave behind her.

"..."

Think, Kiara, think! Think of some small talk -- anything to make this slightly less awkward than sitting in silence while 'Aslan' gives you that dumb, head-empty grin!

"So... um... uh..." Kiara stammers. "You, um, come here of--" Not that! "I mean, um, you look like you f--" Not that either! "Uh... um... how... long have you been here? Outside this cave, I mean."

'Aslan' shrugs in response again. "I dunno how time works here, actually, so maybe a couple hours, maybe a couple weeks. Who knows?"

'Aslan' takes a bite from another rock she withdraws from her pocket, continuing the speak to Kiara through a mouthful of calcite.

"Howuhbout youh? Youh comeh toh thish weird, shpooky chave offten?"

"I, uh, no." Kiara replies, wiping a fleck of rock dust from her cheek. "I live in the tundra, with my sister, Eli. Me and her own this tavern toge--"

She pauses.

"How long did you say?"

"Ah, yeah." 'Aslan' replies. "Time here is weird compared to where I come from -- real weird. It's a long story -- a long, long-ass story. I could tell you it some time -- if you paid me for it. I don't work for free, even if the work is storytelling."

"Well, not like I have anything better to do. How much would you want for your 'long-arse' story? A gold piece?"

No, wait, Kiara thinks. Lemme guess -- she wants even more than that for her dumb life story. Two gold, three gold, maybe even five. Why was she even trying to pay this random girl for a story she didn't even care about? This feels like some kind of classic tourist scam -- not that this is the right place for that, but still. Soon enough, she'd be fleecing her out of even more than that -- maybe even a couple platinum, or even her weapons, maybe even the very clothes off her b--

"Rocks. Two, maybe three depending on the quality."

Ah. Right, that seems more on brand. Where could she get some 'quality' rocks?

Kiara glances past 'Aslan', looking into the mines behind her, trying to get a good look down the corridors from out here, watching for any movement. She sees none.

"Hey..." she says. "If you want some good rocks, then a mine's probably a good place to look, right? If we head deeper in, we might be able to find some really... tasty ones... for you... to eat..."

'Aslan' appears delighted by the idea, hopping quickly to her feet. "Oh, hell yeah! Let's go, new pal!"

"Heh." Kiara snorts. "What, so we're buddy-buddy now, madam 'you're an evil archfey'?"

"Yup!" Replies 'Aslan'. "I wouldn't be following you into a creepy mineshaft if you weren't, even if there were rocks."

"...Really?" asks Kiara.

'Aslan' grins at her. "Yeah? I don't know how much clearer I can get about it. Let's just go already, new friend!" Aslan begins pulling Kiara towards the mine entrance by her forearm.

Kiara grins back at Aslan.
