Kiara takes a step back.

Then another.

Then another.

Then, with a swoosh of air that whips up the dirt around, three pairs of bat-like wings unfurl themselves from Kiara's back, stretching out from behind her sweater. With one beat, they lift her off of the ground; with another beat, she is pushed away from the girl; with successive beats, she puts solid distance between the two of them.

"Y... You..." She stammers, her wide eyes of terror meeting the girl's wide eyes of confusion.

"Y-you're not from my chat, are you? I... No..." she continues, hands subconsciously curling into fists.

The girl narrows her eyes at Kiara. "...What's a chat?"

Kiara's fists tighten further, nails digging into her own skin. "Don't play dumb with me! I'm done with streaming, okay? Done!"

"...What's streaming?"

Kiara exhales sharply. "It's not working on me. I can see right through you. You know exactly what I'm talking about."

"...No?" the girl replies. "Like, I know what we're having right now is a chat -- but I don't know how I'd be from one, considering it's, like, a concept, and not a place; as for streaming, I guess I do swim in them from time to time... Is there something wrong with that? Is the water, like, dirty, or something?"

Kiara's anger evaporates, her palms breathing a sigh of relief as her fists unclench; but, rather than gone entirely, the rage has instead morphed into confusion: unless she's a master actor, there's no way this girl could be this dumb on purpose, right? If she really knew Kiara, surely her reaction would falter from something other than that weird look of confusion on her face -- like a little hamster staring out of the bars of its cage, cute, but utterly devoid of conscious thought. Besides, the fact she didn't appear to be making any kind of move against her in this moment -- and was, rather, leaning down in order to shovel some pebbles from her hand into her mouth -- was enough to convince her. She might look like a demon, but this 'Aslan' was nothing of the sort, nothing more than a simple tieflign. Not remotely cunning enough -- or, at least, so cunning she hadn't yet seen through it.

Kiara sighs, the beating of her wings slowing to the point that she touches back down onto soft ground that surrounds the cave. "Fine. I guess not -- but that doesn't make your name any less fake, 'Aslan Lastname', nor does it make you any less of a stranger. Who are you _actually_?"

'Aslan' shakes her head. "Nuh-uh! I don't just give out my real name like that to complete strangers -- for all I know, you could be some kind of powerful archfey! You certainly have the look of one."

"Archfey? What makes _me_ look like an 'archfey'?"

"Well, the pretty wings, the white hair, the weird eyes, all sorts of things!"

"Hm. Fair enough, I suppose I--"

Kiara pauses.

"Hey, hold on a sec..."

She stares into 'Aslan's' eyes.

"What do you mean I have 'weird eyes'? Yours are way stranger than mine!"

"What? What about them makes them strange?"

"Blood red -- darker than mine -- no pupils, a bit too glassy... all of that seems pretty strange to me."

'Aslan' considers this for a moment.
"Huh. I guess not."

"Exactly!" Kiara replies. "So I how do I know you aren't a fey?"

'Aslan' shrugs. "I dunno."

"You 'dunno'?"

"Yup. I dunno. Even more reason to give each other fake names then, right, person-whose-name-I-know?"

Kiara gives an exasperated sigh.
"Sure. Whatever, I guess. What are you doing here, anyway?" she asks, sitting down on the ground next to 'Aslan'. "You're not from my chat and you're... _probably_ not a fey, so what business do you have here? It's dangerous as hell out here -- last time I came, it was swarming with weirdos with cattle prods."

"I dunno what a cattle prod is, but this place has some pretty sweet rocks -- like this one!" she says, picking up a pebble from the ground, tossing it into the air, and catching it in her jaws, biting down on it with another crunch. Kiara shudders slightly at the sound, the grinding of teeth against sending a fizzling chill along her spine. "Good stuff. A little salty, sure, but good stuff nonetheless."

"A cattle prod is a little electric..." she sighs, spotting another of 'Aslan's' just-not-getting-it looks spread plainly across her face. "Don't worry about it." A small smile replaces 'Aslan's' look of confusion.

Ugh, Kiara thinks. As stupid as she might be, there's something in that look of hers that's almost... cute -- like watching a puppy without object permenance discover that it's toys still exist when they leave its view; or a baby crawl across the floor. Either way, the mixture of cuteness and pity it evokes for Kiara is enough to make her not want to leave 'Aslan' entirely to the mercy of whatever's in the cave behind her. For now, best to sit with her for a while and find something to talk about. Who knows -- it might even end up being fun.

"..."

Uh oh.

"..."

Think, Kiara, think! Think of some small talk -- anything to make this slightly less awkward than sitting in silence while 'Aslan' gives you that dumb, head-empty grin!

"So... um... uh..." Kiara stammers. "You, um, come here of--" Not that! "I mean, um, did it hurt when you fe--" Not that either! "Uh... um... how... long have you been here? Outside this cave, I mean." ...Better.

'Aslan' shrugs in response again. "I dunno how time works here, actually, so maybe a couple hours, maybe a couple weeks. Who knows?"

She withdraws another rock from her pocket, biting a chunk out of it, contiuing to speak with her mouth now full of calcite.

"Howuhbout youh? Youh comeh toh thish weird, shpooky chave offten?"

"I, uh, no." Kiara replies, wiping a fleck of gravel from her cheek. "I live out in the tundra, with my br--... my _sister_, Eli. In fact, me and her run a little tavern out there toge--"

She pauses.

"How long did you say??"

"Ah, yeah." 'Aslan' replies. "Time here is weird compared to where I come from -- real weird. It's a long story -- a long, long-ass story. I could tell you it some time... if you were willing to pay me for it."

"Well, not like I have anything better to do. How much would you want for your 'long-arse' story? A gold piece?"

No, wait, Kiara thinks. Lemme guess -- she wants even more than that for her dumb life story. Two gold, three gold, maybe even five. Why was she even trying to pay this random girl for a story she didn't even care about? This feels like some kind of classic tourist scam -- not that this is the right place for that, but still. Soon enough, she'd be fleecing her out of even more than that -- a couple platinum, maybe her weapons, perhaps even the very clothes off her b--

"Rocks. Three of them -- or two, depending on the quality."

Ah. Right, that seems more on brand. Where could she get some 'quality' rocks?

Kiara leans back slightly, glancing past 'Aslan'. She looks into the mines behind the girl, trying to get a good look down into mine entrance, watching for any movement. She sees none.

"Hey..." she says. "If you want some good rocks, then a mine's probably a good place to look, right? If we head deeper in, we might be able to find some really... tasty ones... for you... to eat..."

'Aslan' appears delighted by the idea, hopping quickly to her feet. "Oh, hell yeah! Let's go, new bestie!"

"Heh." Kiara snorts. "So, what, we're buddy-buddy now, after you thought I was an evil archfey, like, two minutes ago?"

"Yup!" Replies 'Aslan'. "I wouldn't be following you into a creepy mineshaft if you weren't, even if there are good rocks in it."

"...Really?" asks Kiara.

'Aslan' grins at her. "Yeah? I don't know how much clearer I can get about it. Let's just go already!" With that, Aslan begins yanking Kiara towards the mine entrance by her forearm.

Kiara grins back at Aslan.
